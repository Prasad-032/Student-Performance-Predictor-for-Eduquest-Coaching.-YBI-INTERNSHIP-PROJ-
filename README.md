üîç Project Overview: Student Performance Predictor for EduQuest Coaching
Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a Machine Learning model that predicts student academic performance using various factors. This tool helps EduQuest Coaching proactively identify students at risk and personalize support strategies to improve their success and retention.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Features & Workflow
Dataset Used:

The dataset contains key features such as:

Previous academic scores

Attendance records

Participation and engagement in coursework

Demographic details (e.g., age, gender, etc.)

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables (e.g., gender, course name)

Normalized/standardized numerical features to improve model performance

Model Development:

Tested multiple Machine Learning algorithms like:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Selected the best-performing model for final deployment

Outcome Prediction:

Predicts whether a student will perform well or may need intervention

Output helps in recommending targeted mentoring or academic support

üéØ Impact for EduQuest Coaching
Early Detection: Identifies students at risk of low performance

Personalized Support: Helps in tailoring learning plans

Improved Retention: Boosts student engagement and success rates

üí° Final Thoughts
This project combines data science and education to enhance learning outcomes. It can be integrated into EduQuest's existing system to offer real-time performance monitoring and enable data-driven decision-making for student support.
