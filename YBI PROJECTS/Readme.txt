🧠 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts student academic performance based on various factors such as:

Previous academic scores

Attendance records

Engagement in coursework

Demographic details

By leveraging this model, EduQuest Coaching can:

Identify students at risk

Offer personalized mentoring

Improve retention and overall performance

📂 Files in this Repository

→ Jupyter Notebook with complete data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

🔍 Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Normalized/standardized data for better model accuracy

Model Training

Tried multiple ML algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM

Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Prediction & Insights

The best-performing model predicts whether a student is likely to succeed or need additional support
